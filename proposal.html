            <h2>Topic Description</h2>

            <p>
                As a college student, money can be hard to come by. Many students treat their 
                schoolwork as a full-time job, spending 15+ hours a week in lectures and labs, plus 
                another hour or two per class studying the material, doing homework, and preparing 
                for exams. Pile on top of that extra-curricular activities like clubs, volunteering, 
                or visiting a professor’s office hours, and we can easily reach 40 hours a week doing 
                solely school-related tasks. That leaves very little time for someone to be able to 
                work a part-time job, although many students push through and squeeze in a job with 
                their school schedule. But even then, a part-time job is not enough to pay for the 
                things that your typical college student has to pay for such as bills, tuition, 
                personal activities, transportation, etc. Financial aid usually isn’t enough to cover 
                everything that a student needs either, so what can students do to earn some money 
                or better manage their current financial situation amidst their busy school life? 
            </p>
            <p>
                For our project topic, we’d like to help college students get some extra money in 
                their pockets to help make the college experience more affordable and leave students 
                in a better place after graduation without having as much student debt. We’d like to 
                create a web application within this topic that helps students earn some extra money 
                on the side, or help students manage their money better so students can minimize 
                wasting money on things that don’t matter and instead spend money on things that they 
                need. Another potential web application we could create is something that teaches 
                better financial literacy skills that can help set up students for success later on.

            <h2>Potential Web Applications</h2>

            <h3>Idea 1: Money Budgeter/Calendar Hybrid <i class="fas fa-money-bill-alt"></i></h3>
            <p>
                ur main goal of this first idea is to help people in managing their time and money. 
                We want them to maximize the time and money they have and eventually become more 
                productive. We believe if they can manage their time and money well, their chances 
                to become successful will highly increase.
            </p>

            <p>
                The specific questions the application will allow our users to ask are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    How effective do you think your application would help us increase our
                    producivity?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the methods that your app will implement to help us become more
                    productives in terms of time and money?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In our app, we want to help the users to get more things done in a timely manner. 
                To start using the app, the users should input everything they need to accomplish 
                on that day or so. Our app will then interpret and categorize the task for the 
                users based on their inputs. For example, if the user creates a task to “Finish 
                INFO 340 assignment due on Monday (2/7/2020) at 10 pm #SUPER_IMPORTANT”, our app 
                will directly schedule a reminder for the user depends on how many times the user 
                desires the app to remind and categorize the task into the “SUPER_IMPORTANT” 
                section. This could remind the user and keep them on track to become more productive 
                on that day. In addition, our app can help control the user’s finances by tracking 
                their expenses. Our app can automatically track and categorize every expense that 
                the user makes on linked credit or debit card. From there, our app can show the cash 
                flow with an ability to break down expenses by category and dig in deeper where the 
                users see concerning spending habits in a specific time. At the end of the week, the 
                data of the money expenses of the user and all the tasks completed by the user will 
                be recorded and sent to the email of the user.

            <h3>Idea 2: University of Washington Clothing Exchange Website <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i></h3>
            <p>
                With the University of Washington Clothing Exchange website, students can post their 
                apparel items that they no longer want for sale to the greater UW community. This will 
                give students a way to earn some extra income on the side to use on whatever expenses 
                they may have. This will give buyers and sellers a higher level of confidence in the 
                fact that they will be interacting with other University of Washington students rather 
                than random strangers on the internet that you may encounter while trying to sell on 
                other apps like Facebook, Craigslist, Offer Up, etc., as we would like to implement 
                single sign-on that official UW websites use. If we aren’t able to implement this, then 
                we can enforce registering an account on our site with an @uw.edu email address as well. 
                Another feature we’d like to implement is a way to reserve spaces on campus for when you’d 
                like to meet with the other person to buy/sell/trade. One more feature we were brainstorming 
                is that we could create an RSO on campus that is involved with the website that offers the 
                service of legit-checking any apparel being traded on the website. This can add an added layer 
                of confidence that the product you’re buying is a legitimate product and not a fake. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The specific questions this site will allow our users to ask are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What kinds of items can I sell on this website?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Who is allowed to sell on this website?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How will this website improve the experience of buying/selling/trading for UW
                    students?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The users on this site will create an account with their @uw.edu email address or with the 
                UW’s SSO, whichever one we are able to implement. Once registered, users will be able to 
                post their items on the website by uploading pictures, adding text descriptions and a list 
                of available times they are able to meet. Users will be able to message each other on this 
                site to help communication between two interested users. Once two parties reach agreement 
                on a price, they can select a meeting place on campus if available or set their own meeting 
                location off campus. Users will then be able to leave reviews and feedback on each other, 
                rating the transaction. 
            </p>

            <h3>Idea 3: Exportable Web Planner <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
            <img class="calendar" src="images/calendar_example.png" alt="A sample picture of an Outlook calendar">
            <p>
                This last idea is an easy-to-use planner that users can use to create a schedule without
                the need for creating an account with Microsoft, Google, or any other provider that offers a
                calendar service, or downloading a program like Outlook. With this website, you can create 
                a schedule without creating an account, although to save your schedule without losing it 
                the next time you visit the webpage, you'll have to create an account. You can then set cell
                phone text or email reminders of events on your calendar, or even export this calendar to 
                another calendar application like Apple's Calendar, Microsoft's Outlook, Google's Gmail, 
                etc. if you so choose. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The specific questions this site will allow our users to ask are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    How will this be easier to use than something like Outlook?
                </li>
                <li>
                    After making a calendar, how can I use it within my life and how will it benefit me?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                With this site, users will click "begin" on the landing page and will be taking to a
                blank calendar page that users will interact with to create their schedule. They can
                block out time blocks for any appointments/meetings, make recurrent events that happen
                across a specific timespan, and other features that many calendar applications have.
                Some additional features will be the ability set email/text reminders and to export 
                this calendar to an Outlook, Gmail, Apple, etc. calendar application that you can 
                then use without needing to go back to the webpage and instead using the native apps 
                on your devices.
